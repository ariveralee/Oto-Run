# Oto-Run

<p> Oto has been stranded on a planet. He's not much of a good robot, so all he knows how to do is just run with the planet.
There's one small problem however, there's obstacles in his path. The current version works and will be updated as I get the time. <b>Please make sure to take a look at the controls below</b>. It will save you a few strands of hair. </p>
